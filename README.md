# Rosalind Bio-Informatics Exercises

These exercises have been created and submitted by various users from [Rosalind.info](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/). I just solved the exercises and I also wrote my own test suites for each exercises as a way to learn how JS/ES6 testing suites work and how to write them.
